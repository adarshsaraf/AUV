## Battery:

Sent the data to Kailash, need a report back on the size and weight of the whole thing. Maybe have a physical meeting where I discuss more about battery and BMS. Give this back to the mechanical team.

Modularity of the Battery pack and Checking the transportation rules of batteries.

On Air India site: “lithium ion batteries the Watt-hour rating must not exceed 100 Wh.”

## Power System:

Some one needs to design the circuit for the voltage regulation of the Mega and other appliances since the battery pack will have a voltage of 16V only. 

Work on kill switch and the relays of the circuit.

PCB design for the whole thing.

## Control System:

Have testing code for the sensors and thrusters, uploaded on GitHub. Need to do rough testing on them on the Oscilloscope. 

Do proper programming for the controls [lot of work].

Work with Mrinmoy and Harsha on Jetson and Arduino connection.

## Actuating:

Design of how the arm will work to carry the balls.

Working of second camera?

## Battery:

**Report from Kailash:** 

- size - 60% of hull
- weight - 12-13 kgs
- price - unknown yet, recheck values first.

Need to find the exact forces that will work on the body to know exactly how much thrust/current we need to work with to create optimum battery. Discuss this with Mechanical team.

Modularity of the Battery pack: shrink wrapping or other boxing method. 

Checking the transportation rules of batteries. Calling Air India and related beuracracy.

## Power System:

Some one needs to design the circuit for the voltage regulation of the Mega and other appliances since the battery pack will have a voltage of 16V only. 

Work on kill switch and the relays of the circuit.

PCB design for the power system.

## Control System:

Have testing code for the sensors and thrusters, uploaded on GitHub. Need to do testing of old/original code on the Oscilloscope. 

Do proper programming for the controls i.e. when the motors should move and how they should move for vectors (unique thruster position) [lot of work].

Work with Mrinmoy and Harsha on Jetson and Arduino connection. Where the control algorithm will sit.

## Actuating:

Design of how the arm will work to carry the balls.
